The relationship between the amounts of gasoline used by each individual is given by a linear equation, and the total amount used by both is provided. The task is to determine the amount of gasoline used by Felicity.\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n1. Define a variable for the unknown quantity (Adhira's gallons of gas).\n2. Express Felicity's gallons of gas in terms of Adhira's gallons using the given relationship (Felicity uses 4 times Adhira's gallons minus 5).\n3. Set up an equation using the total gallons of gas used by both individuals.\n4. Solve the equation to find the value of the variable (Adhira's gallons).\n5. Use the value of the variable to calculate Felicity's gallons.\n\nThe reasoning structure involves setting up and solving a linear equation based on the given relationship and total.\n\n### New problem template\n\n```python\ndef generate_problem_and_solution_code():\n    # Randomly select terms\n    name1 = random.choice(first_names)\n    name2 = random.choice(first_names)\n    item = random.choice(items)\n    place = random.choice(places)\n    county = random.choice(us_counties)\n    county = county['CountyName'] + \", \" + county[\"StateName\"]\n\n    # Variables for use in solution code\n    name1_var = name1.replace(' ', '_')\n    name2_var = name2.replace(' ', '_')\n    item_var = item.replace(' ', '_')\n    place_var = place.replace(' ', '_')\n    county_var = county.replace(' ', '_')\n\n    # Get initial amount and subsequent ratio that ensure an integer result\n    adhira_amount, total_amount = get_params_combination()\n\n    # Felicity's amount is 4 times Adhira's minus 5\n    felicity_amount = 4 * adhira_amount - 5\n\n    # Construct problem statement with specific details\n    problem_statement = f\"{name1} and {name2} took separate trips to {place} in {county}. \"\n    problem_statement += f\"{name1} used {felicity_amount - adhira_amount} less {item} than four times the number of {item} that {name2} used for her trip. \"\n    problem_statement += f\"Together the girls used {total_amount} {item}.

It involves two individuals, uses a linear relationship to define one individual's amount in terms of the other's, and requires solving for one of the amounts given the total. The solution code calculates the result without rounding, while the solution without code (solution_wocode) presents the steps rounded to two decimal places, as required.", "response2": "Upon examining the generated problem and its solution, we can assess whether it meets the specified requirements:\n\n1. The `solution_code` field does not use `//` for division; it uses `/` instead, which is in line with the requirements.\n2. The `get_params_combination()` function is not shown, but we can infer from the context that integer parameters were selected to ensure calculations result in integer values, as the result and the numbers in the `solution_wocode` are integers.\n3.
